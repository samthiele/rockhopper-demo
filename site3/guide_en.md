##  Welcome to Site 3

We do things a bit different here.

(but not really).

- Tell us something cool about this dataset.
- Include general information first.
- Then describe detailed information for each "stop" below.

This content is stored as readily editable markdown (.md) files. A useful guide to writing markdown files can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

To edit the markdown in your browser, double-click this text. Once finished,
use `shift+enter` to render the markdown again.

Note that edited markdown is NOT saved unless you download it using the button below (todo). You can also edit the source text files directly before uploading your virtual field trip. 

## Getting fancy

The text in this section can be long and detailed, and contain pictures or other markdown-compatable formatting.

Tables are also possible:

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   |

As are multiple-guess questions to keep your students on their toes!
