##  Welcome to Site 3

We do things a bit different here.

(but not really).

- Tell us something cool about this dataset.
- Include general information first.
- Then describe detailed information for each "stop" below.

This content is stored as readily editable markdown (.md) files. A useful guide to writing markdown files can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

To edit the markdown in your browser, double-click this text. Once finished,
use `shift+enter` to render the markdown again.

Note that edited markdown is NOT saved unless you download it using the button below (todo). You can also edit the source text files directly before uploading your virtual field trip. 

## Getting fancy

The text in this section can be long and detailed, and contain pictures or other markdown-compatable formatting.

Tables are also possible:

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   |

As are multiple-guess questions to keep your students on their toes!

## Linking to headings and sites

The hash part of the URL can be used to create links in the markdown to specific headings in this markdown file (defined using # or ##). You can see this in action by clicking [here](/#site2) or [here](/#guide).

If these sites area also registered in the `index.json` file, then corresponding changes in the viewer (camera position, render style, point visibility etc.) will be updated, and any defined site audio triggered (todo).

It's assumed (though not essential) that each "site" associated with a virtual field trip will contain a corresponding heading. An example of this can be seen below.

## [Site 1](/#site1)

- Clicking on the link above will zoom directly too it in the dataset, so we can 
  explore ourselves and see what is going on.

- I found a nice rock - check it out!

## [Site 2](/#site2)

- This is another location that we want to explore in this dataset.

- How cool is this place! Look what we can see?
