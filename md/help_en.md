RockHopper virtual field trips should (hopefully!) be quite intuitive to navigate, but this page helps clarify how everything works.

## Navigation Controls

Use the mouse to navigate in 3D point clouds and photospheres. Click and drag to rotate the camera, and use `Middle Click` (or `Shift+Left Click`) to pan. Scrolling should zoom in and out.

`Double Click` on a point cloud dataset to change the center of rotation (this will also rotate the camera to look at the double-clicked point). 

## Annotation Controls

`Ctrl+Left Click` can be used to add annotation points (these should appear initially as small yellow spheres). Once an annotation is finished, press `Enter` to accept or `Esc` to clear it. 

The type of annotation to be added will be decided based on the number of points:

1 Point: Add a `Label` object containing text (or arbitrary HTML).
2 Points: Add a `Vector` object, and add its `trend`, `plunge` and `length` to the Notes tab.
3 Points: Add a `Plane` object, and add its `strike`, `dip` and `dip direction` to the Notes tab.
4+ Points: Add a `Polyline` object. These can be useful for e.g., highlighting linear features (or circling objects of interest).

Note that annotations will be lost if the page is refreshed (unless you are running RockHopper on a local development server); meaning any changes need to be downloaded using the `â¬‡ Notes` button in the bottom left.

Annotations (and HTML Labels) can be hidden or shown using the corresponding toggle buttons in the bottom left of the 3D viewer. The (currently drawn) annotation colour can also be changed by clicking the colour chooser widget.

## Visualisation Controls

A key strength of RockHopper is that multiple attributes of point cloud datasets can be streamed and visualised in different ways. These visualisation `Styles` are defined when the point cloud is converted to a streamable format and given (hopefully) understandable names. 

Use the buttons in the top left of the 3D view to change the view style. The top row changes the colour mapping used to define point colour. The second row can be used to either highlight or hide some subset of the points (based on an underlying classification). This can be useful for e.g., visualising different dates in a time-series dataset, or highlighting specific objects in a point cloud.
